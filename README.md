DEEP RDP

1. Start by entering the depth for the first dive, and the app will return the "maximum bottom time" allowed for that depth.

2. Then, enter the length of time for the first dive, and the app will return the "pressure group" after the first dive. The pressure group is denoted by the letters of the alphabet, and represents the theoretical nitrogen levels accumulated in your system. The higher the letter, the higher the nitrogen levels.

3. To plan for a second dive, enter the surface interval between dives, and the app will return your new pressure group after the interval.

4. Then, enter the depth for the second dive, and the app will return the "residual nitrogen time" and the "adjusted no decompression limit" for that depth. The "adjusted no decompression limit" is the maximum bottom time allowed for that depth after a preliminary dive.

5. Finally, enter the length of time for the second dive, and the app will return the final "pressure group" after the second dive.
